# PokeAPI's pokedex

This projects serves as a short term solution for adding the new generation 8 data to our PokeAPI. We decided to take a temporary shift from [Veekun](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) and allow our community to bring in new data fetched from the Internet. 

We will review any PR or issue that brings in new data and eventually merge it so to have it live at https://pokeapi.co

## How to contribute

In order to contribute to this project you need to fill the CSV files contained in the folder `/pokedex/data/csv/`. You can contribute manually or by fetching the data from a _relatively_ trusted source with a script. If you use a script we would like to have it also committed to this repository inside the `/pokeapi/scripts/` folder.
